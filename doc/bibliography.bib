  abstract = {Where data based decision making is taking over businesses and elite sports, elite soccer is lacking behind. In elite soccer, decisions are still often based on emotions and recent results. As results are, however, dependent on many aspects, the reasons for these results are currently unknown by the elite soccer clubs. In our study, a method is proposed to determine the expected winner of a match. Since goals are rare in soccer, goal scoring opportunities are analyzed instead. By analyzing which team created the best goal scoring opportunities, a feeling can be created which team should have won the game. Therefore, it is important that the quality of goal scoring opportunities accurately reflect reality. Therefore, the proposed method ensures that the quality of a goal scoring opportunity is given as the probability of the goal scoring opportunity resulting in a goal. It is shown that these scores accurately match reality. The quality scores of individual goal scoring opportunities are then aggregated to obtain an expected match outcome, which results in an expected winner. In little more than 50\% of the cases, our method is able to determine the correct winner of a match. The majority of incorrect classified winners comes from close matches where a draw is predicted. The quality scores of the proposed method can already be used by elite soccer clubs. First of all, these clubs can evaluate periods of time more objectively. Secondly, individual matches can be evaluated to evaluate the importance of major events during a match e.g. substitutions. Finally, the quality metrics can be used to determine the performance of players over time which can be used to adjust training programs or to perform player acquisition.

Unfortunately, these detailed data are owned by specialized companies and hence are rarely publicly available for scientific research. To fill this gap, we provide to the public the largest open collection of soccer-logs ever released, collected by Wyscout (https://wyscout.com/) containing all the spatio-temporal events (passes, shots, fouls, etc.) that occur during all matches of an entire season of seven competitions (La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, Premier League, Ligue 1, FIFA World Cup 2018, UEFA Euro Cup 2016). A match event contains information about its position, time, outcome, player and characteristics. This dataset has been used recently during the Soccer Data Challenge (https://sobigdata-soccerchallenge.it/) and, to the best of our knowledge, it is the largest public collectionof soccer-logs.If you use these data for your research or analyses, cite the following paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0247-7},

  abstract = {Football is a sport that has the most fans in the world. What makes sebak patterns so popular are their uncertain and unpredictable results. There are many factors that affect the outcome of a football match, including strategy, skill, and even luck. Therefore, guessing the results of a soccer match is an interesting problem. All shots are grouped into sections on the playing field and theoretical goal scores are applied to each area. The factors analyzed are: distance of shot from goal and angle of shot in relation to goal. When calculating xG, it is recommended that the distance and angle of the shot are important. The combination of the two xG factors is better calculated than each variable only. In addition, this xG check has been able to relatively accurately identify the mid-table teams that score and concede goals.},
