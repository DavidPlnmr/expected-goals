  abstract = {Where data based decision making is taking over businesses and elite sports, elite soccer is lacking behind. In elite soccer, decisions are still often based on emotions and recent results. As results are, however, dependent on many aspects, the reasons for these results are currently unknown by the elite soccer clubs. In our study, a method is proposed to determine the expected winner of a match. Since goals are rare in soccer, goal scoring opportunities are analyzed instead. By analyzing which team created the best goal scoring opportunities, a feeling can be created which team should have won the game. Therefore, it is important that the quality of goal scoring opportunities accurately reflect reality. Therefore, the proposed method ensures that the quality of a goal scoring opportunity is given as the probability of the goal scoring opportunity resulting in a goal. It is shown that these scores accurately match reality. The quality scores of individual goal scoring opportunities are then aggregated to obtain an expected match outcome, which results in an expected winner. In little more than 50\% of the cases, our method is able to determine the correct winner of a match. The majority of incorrect classified winners comes from close matches where a draw is predicted. The quality scores of the proposed method can already be used by elite soccer clubs. First of all, these clubs can evaluate periods of time more objectively. Secondly, individual matches can be evaluated to evaluate the importance of major events during a match e.g. substitutions. Finally, the quality metrics can be used to determine the performance of players over time which can be used to adjust training programs or to perform player acquisition.

  abstract = {Soccer analytics is attracting an increasing interest of academia and industry, thanks to the availability of sensing technologies that provide high-fidelity data streams extracted from every match.  Unfortunately, these detailed data are owned by specialized companies and hence are rarely publicly available for scientific research. To fill this gap, we provide to the public the largest open collection of soccer-logs ever released, collected by Wyscout (https://wyscout.com/) containing all the spatio-temporal events (passes, shots, fouls, etc.) that occur during all matches of an entire season of seven competitions (La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, Premier League, Ligue 1, FIFA World Cup 2018, UEFA Euro Cup 2016). A match event contains information about its position, time, outcome, player and characteristics. This dataset has been used recently during the Soccer Data Challenge (https://sobigdata-soccerchallenge.it/) and, to the best of our knowledge, it is the largest public collectionof soccer-logs.If you use these data for your research or analyses, cite the following paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0247-7},

To fill this gap, this paper describes the largest open collection of soccer-logs ever released, containing all the spatio-temporal events (passes, shots, fouls, etc.) that occured during each match for an entire season of seven prominent soccer competitions. Each match event contains information about its position, time, outcome, player and characteristics. The nature of team sports like soccer, halfway between the abstraction of a game and the reality of complex social systems, combined with the unique size and composition of this dataset, provide an ideal ground for tackling a wide range of data science problems, including the measurement and evaluation of performance, both at individual and at collective level, and the determinants of success and failure.},
